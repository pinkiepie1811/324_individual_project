These visualizations are the summary of the gene expressions in the human brain's frontal cortex tissues.
The goal of these graphs is to help scientists easily notice the trends and outliers in this dataset and, therefore, gain a direction for further investigation.
The questions can be answered through these visualisations:
- What are the demographics of the samples
- Solely based on expression levels, what are the correlations between the genes
- Is there any difference between male and female samples?
- Is there any segregation between samples of different age groups?

To run the code, please clone this repo and extract the data from *.gct.gz as "gene_exp.gct"
