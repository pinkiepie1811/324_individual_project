These visualizations are the summary of the gene expressions in human brain frontal cortex tissues.
The goal of these graph is to make scientists easily notice the trends and outliers in this dataset, and, therefore, gain a direction in further investigation.
The questions can be answered through these visualtions:
- What are the demographics of the samples
- Solely based on expression levels, what are the correlation between the genes
- Is there any difference between male and female samples?
- Is there any seggragation between samples of different age group?

To run the code, please clone this repo and extract the data from *.tar.gz as "gene_exp.gct"
